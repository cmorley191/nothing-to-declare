## 1.1 TODO
- (DONE) game settings
  - initially just number of rounds
- (DONE) officer indicator along top instead of an officer section
- (DONE) reference chart of products
- (DONE) game setting: swap modes -- simple or strategic
  - simple: swap and pack in the same stage, simultaneously with other traders. no taking contracts from recycle pool (recycle pool does not exist)
  - strategic: swap sequentially, taking and recycling contracts via recycle pool. then pack simultaneously (start packing as soon as local swap complete)
- chat window with game log
- optionally add text message on deal
- make deals with supplies products
- pay fines with supplies products if out of money
- approval stamp officer tool
- hammer officer tool
- make deals at any time
- traders and officer select a particular recycle pool to discard recycled and illegal-caught contracts
- swap stage animations for clarity


## Unprioritized
- layout
  - center area dummy div should shrink before scrollbar appears

- improvements
  - red, bigger crowbar
  - need more obvious distinction between supply contracts and cart contents
  - midgame point indicator needs revamp (breakdown?)
  - ability to undo cart pack (go back) while others are still packing
  - ability to modify claim message while others are still packing
  - claim message shown during interrogation
  - dialogue animation / sounds for proposed deals
  - game end points tie rules
